\chapter{Game Theory - Smart Grid}
\assignment{
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 2 consumers of electrical power from the grid: $c_1$ and $c_2$
    \item Each may consume either $c_1(h)$ or $c_2(h)$ reps. of energy each hour
    \item Hours are indexed $h \in [0,\ldots,23]$
    \item $c_1$ needs 5 units from between 02 and 10 o’clock
    \item $c_2$ needs 10 units between 05 an 20 o’clock
    \item Energy prize/unit $P_u$ is set per hour and increases linearly with total demand for that hour.
    \item The cost of each user is his/her total daily electricity bill.
    \item What is the set of strategies for each player.
    \item Find the combined (optimal) strategy, which minimizes total cost (summed for both users).
    \item Find a Nash equilibrium.
    \item Does the optimal strategy coincide with the NE? (hint: Lagrange multipliers)
  \end{enumerate}
