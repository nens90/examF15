\assignment{Game theory is a formal framework with a set of mathematical tools to study the complex interactions among
independent rational players. It is actively applied in economics, politics, sociology and other social science. One can
also employ it to model and analyze modern communication and control systems. We will introduce Game Theory by playing a
game. The game is organized into players, their strategies, and their goals or payoffs. We will learn a principle of
never selecting a dominated strategy, how to find Nash equilibrium and what a mixed strategy is. }
